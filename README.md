Write a program, that will check the list of domains for accessibility

Once a minute we need to check, if domains are available and get their ping.
We have many users, who want to know domains ping.
Users have three options:

1. Get the time for specific domain

3. Get the domain with max ping

Both we have administrators, who want to get statistics for this endpoints
